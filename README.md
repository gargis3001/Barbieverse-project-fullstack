## 🎬 Barbieverse – Movie Review Platform

**Barbieverse** is a full-stack movie review platform where users can explore Barbie-themed movies, read community reviews, and submit their own feedback with a vibrant, heart-based rating system.

This project combines a Java + Spring Boot backend with a modern React-based frontend — all styled with a bold, Barbie-inspired aesthetic.

### ✨ Why I Built This

Barbieverse was created as a fun and educational full-stack project to:

- Practice **RESTful API development** using Java and Spring Boot  
- Apply **React 19** concepts like hooks, routing, and component-based architecture  
- Explore **frontend-backend integration** using Axios and Postman  
- Design an interactive, themed UI with **Bootstrap**, **MUI**, and **React Bootstrap**  
- Reinforce concepts in **state management**, **form handling**, and **API testing**

It’s both a passion project and a portfolio piece showcasing full-stack development skills.
